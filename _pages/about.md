Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them

## Clinical trial design

Suppose you're trying to find the best over-the-counter medicine that works for you for a mildly harmful condition such as seasonal allergies. In the near future, we could imagine that you download an App which is designed to figure out the best medication for you by recommending (possibly different) medications every morning, and taking feedback from you on how well it worked every night. One might think that this sort of futuristic medical care could be better that what is currently standard practice in the medical community: randomized controlled trials.
